Function:
    MCHP_PSF_HOOK_UPDHW_INTF_INIT()
Summary:
    Initialize the hardware interface(SPI/I2C) used for communicating with UPD350 part.
Description:
    PSF requires a Hardware interface from SOC(either SPI or I2C) to communicate with UPD350. UPD350 
    supports either I2C or SPI interface depending on UPD350 SKU used.  UPD350 A and C SKUs support
    I2C interface and UPD350 B and D SKUs support SPI interface. 
    This Hook is used to initialize the SOC's Hardware interface for communication. It is called 
    during initialization of PSF. This hook is assigned to a function that takes no arguments and
    has a return type of UINT8 which indicates if the initialization was successful or not. 
Conditions:
    Use SPI interface for part UPD350 B and D.
    Use I2C interface for part UPD350 A and C.
Return:
    UINT8 - Return TRUE if initialization was successful or else return FALSE. If hardware 
            interface initialization(SPI/I2C) fails and the API returns FALSE, all the PD ports
            are disabled by PSF by default.
Example:
    <code>
        #define MCHP_PSF_HOOK_UPDHW_INTF_INIT()      hw_spi_init()
        UINT8 hw_spi_init(void);
        UINT8 hw_spi_init(void)
        {
            //Intialise SOC's SPI master
            //Return TRUE if initialsation is successful else FALSE
        }
    </code>
    <code>
        #define MCHP_PSF_HOOK_UPDHW_INTF_INIT()      hw_i2c_init()

Function:
    MCHP_PSF_HOOK_HW_PDTIMER_INIT() 
Summary:
    Hook to Initialize and start the hardware timer module.
Description:
    PSF requires a single dedicated hardware timer module for synchronizing the various state
    machines in the stack. This Hook initializes and starts the hardware timer module for 
    MCHP_PSF_PDTIMER_INTERRUPT_RATE interrupt frequency. To inform PSF about the occurrence 
    of hardware timer interrupt, MchpPSF_PDTimerHandler should be called by the SOC layer on every
    occurrence of the timer interrupt. This hook is assigned to a function that takes no arguments
    and has a return type of UINT8. 
Conditions:
    None.
Return:
    UINT8 - Returns TRUE if initialization is successful else FALSE. If Timer initialization fails 
            and the API returns FALSE, all the PD ports are disabled by PSF by default.
Example:
    <code>
        #define MCHP_PSF_HOOK_HW_PDTIMER_INIT()		Timer_Init()
        UINT8 Timer_Init(void);
        UINT8 Timer_Init(void)

Summary:
	Rate at which the Hardware PD timer generates an interrupt 
Description:
    MCHP_PSF_PDTIMER_INTERRUPT_RATE defines the frequency of interrupt set in the hardware timer 
    dedicated for PSF. In other words, it is the resolution of the hardware timer. It can be 
    configured depending on the resolution of the hardware timer available.
Remarks:
    Resolution of the hardware timer has to be at least 1ms. Tested resolution values of hardware 
    timer is 1ms.(Corresponding MCHP_PSF_PDTIMER_INTERRUPT_RATE value is 1000).
Example:
    <code>
        #define MCHP_PSF_PDTIMER_INTERRUPT_RATE		1000 
		(1000 interrupts per second, with interrupt interval or resolution of 1ms)

Description :
    MCHP_PSF_CONFIG_16BIT_PDTIMER_COUNTER can be defined as either 1 or 0 to set the timeout counter in PSF 
    to unsigned 16bit or unsigned 32bit correspondingly. When set as 1, maximum timeout that can be 
    set will be 65535 ticks.(Ticks = Resolution of the Hardware timer used). When set as 0, maximum 
    timeout that can be set will be 4294967296 ticks. Default value of MCHP_PSF_CONFIG_16BIT_PDTIMER_COUNTER is 
    set as 1. With Hardware timer resolution set as 1ms, PSF will be capable of handling timeouts 
    upto 65.535 Seconds.

    state based on this notification. This notification occurs only when 
    INCLUDE_POWER_MANAGEMENT_CTRL is defined as 1.
    
    <b> eMCHP_PSF_VCONN_PWR_FAULT:</b> UPD350 has VCONN comparators to detect VCONN OCS faults. 
	This event is notified when VCONN OCS fault is detected by UPD350. For this notification, PSF
	expects a return value to decide whether to handle the fault occurred. When user returns TRUE
	for VCONN power fault, Incase of explicit contract, if VCONN power fault count is less than
	u8VCONNMaxFaultCnt, PSF DPM power fault manager handles it by sending Hard Reset. If the count 
    exceeds max fault count,VCONN is powered off until physical detach of port partner. Incase of 
    implicit contract, PSF handles by entering TypeC Error Recovery. This notification occurs only 
    when INCLUDE_POWER_FAULT_HANDLING is defined as 1.
    
    <b> eMCHP_PSF_VBUS_PWR_FAULT</b>: PSF notifies all VBUS power fault VBUS Over voltage, VBUS
	under voltage, VBUS OCS via this notification. For this notification, PSF expects a return
	value to decide whether to handle the fault occurred.When user returns TRUE for power fault,
    Incase of explicit contract, if power fault count is less than u8VBUSMaxFaultCnt, 
    PSF DPM power fault manager handles it by sending Hard Reset. When the power fault count 
    exceeds the max fault count, CC termination on the port is removed until the physical detach of
  	the port partner. Incase of implicit contract, PSF handles by entering TypeC Error Recovery. 
    This notification occurs only when INCLUDE_POWER_FAULT_HANDLING is defined as 1.
 
    <b> eMCHP_PSF_RECOVERED_FRM_VCONN_PWR_FAULT </b>: This event is notified when a port is recovered
    from  VCONN power fault if the VCONN is stable for u16PowerGoodTimerInms without 
    any further fault occurrence. PSF clears VCONN fault recorded with this notification.
    
    <b> eMCHP_PSF_RECOVERED_FRM_VBUS_PWR_FAULT </b>: This event is notified when a port

    that a port has been disabled as a result of port disable client request (BIT[0] in 
    gasCfgStatusData.sPerPortData[u8PortNum].u32ClientRequest variable). When a port is disabled,
    any connection to the port is prevented by removing all terminations from the CC pins. 
    A disabled port will continue to be in disabled state even after the port partner is
    physically detached and attached. The port can only be revived by a client request to 
    enable the port (BIT[1] in gasCfgStatusData.sPerPortData[u8PortNum].u32ClientRequest variable).

                                                 It is recommended to configure SOC GPIOs interrupt in edge
                                                 level detection with internal pull up since the UPD350

Summary:
    Indicates the implicit/explicit current capability of attached source partner.
Description:
    This hook is used by PSF to inform the sink about the implicit/explicit current
    capability of the attached source partner. The current capability is 
    indicated through a voltage level on Digital to Analog Converter(DAC)'s 
    output pin. The voltage level on DAC's output pin is calculated based on 
    per port Configuration parameters, which were configured using 
    MCHP_PSF_HOOK_BOOT_TIME_CONFIG(pasCfgStatusData) hook.
