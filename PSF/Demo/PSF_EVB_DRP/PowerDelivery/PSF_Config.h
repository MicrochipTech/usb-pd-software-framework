    USB-PD V3.0 support code inclusion.
Description:
    Setting the INCLUDE_PD_3_0 as 1, enables PSF to include USB Power delivery 3.0 specification
    features(collision avoidance and extended message support via chunking) along with PD 2.0 features
	at compile time. Users can set this define to 0 to reduce code size if none of the PD 
    enabled ports require PD 3.0 specific features.

	compile time. Users can set this define to 0 to reduce code size if none of the PD 
    enabled ports are configured for DRP operation.
Remarks:

/**************************************************************************************************
Summary:
    PIO Override Feature code inclusion.
Description:
    PIO override is UPD350 specific feature which changes the state of a PIO without software
    intervention. PSF uses this feature to disable EN_VBUS(in case of source operation) or  
	EN_SINK(in case of sink operation) instantly on detection of a Power Fault or Fast Role Swap
    Condition. Setting the INCLUDE_UPD_PIO_OVERRIDE_SUPPORT as 1 enables this feature. Users can 
    set this define to 0 to reduce code size of PSF if PIO override based power fault handling 
    is not required. It is recommended that this define shall be set when Fast Role Swap feature
    is enabled since Fast Role Swap is tightly coupled with PIO Override feature. 
Remarks:
    To use this feature, EN_VBUS or EN_SINK, FAULT_IN and EN_FRS pins of the system should be
    UPD350 PIOs. It is also confined to INCLUDE_POWER_FAULT_HANDLING define, thus 
    INCLUDE_POWER_FAULT_HANDLING should be declared as 1 for INCLUDE_UPD_PIO_OVERRIDE_SUPPORT
    define to be effective. Recommended default value is 1 if UPD350 PIOs are used for EN_VBUS, 
    EN_SINK and FAULT_IN.
Example:
    <code>
    #define INCLUDE_UPD_PIO_OVERRIDE_SUPPORT	1(Include UPD350 PIO Override support for Power 
                                                        fault to PSF)

    functionality that puts the UPD350 into low power mode if UPD350 is inactive for 
    15 seconds time and PSF notifies the same via the call back
    MCHP_PSF_NOTIFY_CALL_BACK. Users can set this define to 0 to reduce code size of the PSF 
    if low power mode operation of UPD350 is not required for the application.
Remarks:

	<b>CONFIG_UPD350_SPI</b> - SPI is the communication interface between SOC and UPD350.
									SPI interface is supported by UPD350 B and D parts alone.
	
	<b>CONFIG_UPD350_I2C</b> - I2C is the communication interface between SOC and UPD350.
									I2C interface is supported by UPD350 A and C parts alone.
Remarks:
    CONFIG_DEFINE_UPD350_HW_INTF_SEL should be defined based on UPD350 silicon part used for the
    application. All the ports in a system should use either I2C supported or SPI supported 
    UPD350 part. Using mixed interfaces for individual ports is not supported (i.e.: SPI for 
	Port 1 and I2C for Port 2).

Note:
	If the target for PSF is a UPD301C device, SPI must always be selected. I2C is not an option

    Maximum Firmware image size.
Description:
    CONFIG_MAX_FIRMWARE_IMAGESIZE defines the ROM size allocated for the Updatable application. 
    PDFU Initiator shall flash entire size during every re-flash operation. Flashing lesser or 
    more than this Size results in error response.
Remarks:
    Choose Firmware Image size in such a way that integral multiple of 256. The definition of 
    this function is mandatory when INCLUDE_PDFU is '1' and shall expressed in terms of bytes. 
    By default, the value is 0x8800UL(34KB).
Example:
    <code>
     #define CONFIG_MAX_FIRMWARE_IMAGESIZE 0x9800UL (38*1024 bytes for 38KB Updatable application).

    CONFIG_UPDATABLE_IMAGEBANK_INDEX specifies the Image bank index for which firmware upgrade  
    is requested (or) in other words it corresponds to the image bank index of the Updatable 
    application as mentioned by Architecture 2 of PD FW Update Specification.

    This information is used during the Reconfiguration phase to determine what application is 
    currently executing and whether application switching to Fixed Application is required or not.

	u32ClientRequest variable defines the client request mask bits. It's size is 4 bytes. 
    USER_APPLICATION can set the corresponding bit in this variable to request PSF to handle
    the client requests mentioned in the table below. Only one client request can be handled 
    by PSF at a given time. If more than one client request bits are set at the same time, 
    the requests will be queued internally and processed based on the priority of events where
    bit 0 takes the highest priority and bit 31 takes the least priority. If the request is 
    accepted and processed, a response notification will be posted by PSF. Refer 'Client Requests'
    section under 'Run Time Configuration' for detailed information on the client requests.

   Summary:

   Description:
     gasCfgStatusData is the global structure which defines the overall system level configuration 
	 and status parameters of PSF. This structure contains the system level and port specific 
	 Configuration and Status parameters of PSF including Type C, PD, PB, PT and PPS parameters.
	 
	 It is mandatory that the user has to initialize the configuration parameters for the PSF 
	 stack to function properly. This can be done through MCHP_PSF_HOOK_BOOT_TIME_CONFIG which 
	 initializes the parameters defined in gasCfgStatusData during compile time. For accessing 
	 the configuration registers and reading the status registers at run time, an I2C slave
	 interface shall be used by the user application.
