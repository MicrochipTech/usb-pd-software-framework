/* Function:
    void SERCOM0_SPI_Initialize (void);

  Summary:
    Initializes instance SERCOM0 operating in SPI mode.

  Description:
    This function initializes instance SERCOM0 operating in SPI mode.
    This function should be called before any other library function. The SERCOM
    module will be configured as per the MHC settings.

  Precondition:
    MCC GUI should be configured with the right values. The Generic Clock
    configuration and the SERCOM Peripheral Clock channel should have been
    configured in the clock manager GUI.The function will itself enable the
    required peripheral clock channel and main clock.

  Parameters:
    None.

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
        SERCOM0_SPI_Initialize();
    </code>

  Remarks:
    This function must be called once before any other SPI function is called.

void SERCOM0_SPI_Initialize (void);


// *****************************************************************************
/* Function:
    bool SERCOM0_SPI_TransferSetup(SPI_TRANSFER_SETUP *setup,
                                                uint32_t spiSourceClock);

 Summary:
    Configure SERCOM SPI operational parameters at run time.

  Description:
    This function allows the application to change the SERCOM SPI operational
    parameter at run time. The application can thus override the MHC defined
    configuration for these parameters. The parameter are specified via the
    SPI_TRANSFER_SETUP type setup parameter. Each member of this parameter
    should be initialized to the desired value.

    The application may feel need to call this function in situation where
    multiple SPI slaves, each with different operation paramertes, are connected
    to one SPI master. This function can thus be used to setup the SPI Master to
    meet the communication needs of the slave.

    Calling this function will affect any ongoing communication. The application
    must thus ensure that there is no on-going communication on the SPI before
    calling this function.

  Precondition:
    SERCOM SERCOM0 SPI must first be initialized using SERCOM0_SPI_Initialize().

  Parameters :
    setup - pointer to the data structure of type SPI_TRANSFER_SETUP containing
    the operation parameters. Each operation parameter must be specified even if
    the parameter does not need to change.

    spiSourceClock - Current value of GCLK frequency feeding the SERCOM0 core.

  Returns:
    true - setup was successful.

    false - if spiSourceClock and spi clock frequencies are such that resultant
    baud value is out of the possible range.

  Example:
    <code>
        SPI_TRANSFER_SETUP setup;
        setup.clockFrequency = 1000000;
        setup.clockPhase = SPI_CLOCK_PHASE_TRAILING_EDGE;
        setup.clockPolarity = SPI_CLOCK_POLARITY_IDLE_LOW;
        setup.dataBits = SPI_DATA_BITS_8;

        Assuming 20 MHz as peripheral Master clock frequency
        if (SERCOM0_SPI_TransferSetup (&setup, 20000000) == false)
        {
            this means setup could not be done, debug the reason.
        }

    </code>

  Remarks:
    The application would need to call this function only if the operational
    parameter need to be different than the ones configured in MHC.

/* Function:
    bool SERCOM0_SPI_WriteRead (void* pTransmitData, size_t txSize
                                        void* pReceiveData, size_t rxSize);

  Summary:
    Write and Read data on SERCOM SERCOM0 SPI peripheral.

  Description:
    This function transmits "txSize" number of bytes and receives "rxSize"
    number of bytes on SERCOM SERCOM0 SPI module. Data pointed by pTransmitData is
    transmitted and received data is saved in the location pointed by
    pReceiveData. The function will transfer the maximum of "txSize" or "rxSize"
    data units towards completion.

    When "Interrupt Mode" option is unchecked in MHC, this function will be
    blocking in nature.  In this mode, the function will not return until all
    the requested data is transferred.  The function returns true after
    transferring all the data.  This indicates that the operation has been
    completed.

    When "Interrupt Mode" option is selected in MHC, the function will be
    non-blocking in nature.  The function returns immediately. The data transfer
    process continues in the peripheral interrupt.  The application specified
    transmit and receive buffer  are ownerd by the library until the data
    transfer is complete and should not be modified by the application till the
    transfer is complete.  Only one transfer is allowed at any time. The
    Application can use a callback function or a polling function to check for
    completion of the transfer. If a callback is required, this should be
    registered prior to calling the SERCOM0_SPI_WriteRead() function. The
    application can use the SERCOM0_SPI_IsBusy() to poll for completion.

  Precondition:
    The SERCOM0_SPI_Initialize function must have been called.  If the
    peripheral instance has been configured for Interrupt mode and transfer
    completion status needs to be communicated back to application via callback,
    a callback should have been registered using SERCOM0_SPI_CallbackRegister()
    function.

  Parameters:
    pTransmitData - Pointer to the data which has to be transmitted. In a case
    where only data reception is required, this pointer can be set to NULL. If
    the module is configured for 9 bit data length, the data should be right
    aligned in a 16 bit memory location. The size of this buffer should be
    txSize.

    txSize - Number of bytes to be transmitted. For 9 but data length, a count
    of 1 counts 2 bytes. This value can be different from rxSize.

    pReceiveData - Pointer to the location where the received data has to be
    stored.  It is user's responsibility to ensure that this location has
    sufficient memory to store rxSize amount of data. In a case where only data
    transmission is required, this pointer can be set to NULL.  If the module is
    configured for 9 bit data length, received data will be right aligned and
    will be stored in a 16 bit memory location.

    rxSize - Number of bytes to be received. This value can be different from
    txSize. For 9 bit data length, a size count of 1 indicates 2 bytes required
    to store 9 bits of data.

  Returns:
    true - If configured for Non-interrupt mode, the function has recevied and
    transmitted the requested number of bytes. If configured for Interrupt mode,
    the request was accepted successfully and will be processed in the
    interrupt.

    false - If both pTransmitData and pReceiveData are NULL, or if both txSize
    and rxSize are 0 or if txSize is non-zero but the pTransmitData is set to
    NULL or rxSize is non-zero but pReceiveData is NULL. In Interrupt mode, the
    function returns false if there is an on-going data transfer at the time of
    calling the function.

  Example:
    <code>

     The following code snippet shows an example using the
     SERCOM0_SPI_WriteRead() function in interrupt mode operation using the
     callback function.

    uint8_t     txBuffer[4];
    uint8_t     rxBuffer[10];
    size_t      txSize = 4;
    size_t      rxSize = 10;

    void APP_SPITransferHandler(uintptr_t context)
    {
       Transfer was completed without error, do something else now.
    }

    SERCOM0_SPI_Initialize();
    SERCOM0_SPI_CallbackRegister(&APP_SPITransferHandler, (uintptr_t)NULL);
    if(SERCOM0_SPI_WriteRead(&txBuffer, txSize, &rxBuffer, rxSize))
    {
        request got accepted
    }
    else
    {
        request didn't get accepted, try again later with correct arguments
    }
    The following code snippet shows non-interrupt or blocking mode
    operation.

    uint8_t txBuffer[4];
    uint8_t rxBuffer[10];
    size_t txSize = 4;
    size_t rxSize = 10;

    SERCOM0_SPI_Initialize();

    This function call will block.
    SERCOM0_SPI_WriteRead(&txBuffer, txSize, &rxBuffer, rxSize);

  Remarks:
    None.

  Summary:
    Writes data to SERCOM SERCOM0 SPI peripheral.

  Description:
    This function writes "txSize" number of bytes on SERCOM SERCOM0 SPI module. Data
    pointed by pTransmitData is transmitted.

    When "Interrupt Mode" option is unchecked in MHC, this function will be
    blocking in nature.  In this mode, the function will not return until all
    the requested data is transferred.  The function returns true after
    transferring all the data.  This indicates that the operation has been
    completed.

    When "Interrupt Mode" option is selected in MHC, the function will be
    non-blocking in nature.  The function returns immediately. The data transfer
    process continues in the peripheral interrupt.  The application specified
    transmit buffer  is ownerd by the library until the data transfer is
    complete and should not be modified by the application till the transfer is
    complete.  Only one transfer is allowed at any time. The application can use
    a callback function or a polling function to check for completion of the
    transfer. If a callback is required, this should be registered prior to
    calling the SERCOM0_SPI_WriteRead() function. The application can use the
    SERCOM0_SPI_IsBusy() to poll for completion.

  Precondition:
    The SERCOM0_SPI_Initialize function must have been called.

    Callback has to be registered using SERCOM0_SPI_CallbackRegister API if the
    peripheral instance has been configured in Interrupt mode and
    transfer completion status needs to be communicated back to application via
    callback.

  Parameters:
    pTransmitData - Pointer to the buffer containing the data which has to be
    transmitted.  For 9 bit mode, data should be right aligned in the 16 bit
    memory location. In "Interrupt Mode", this buffer should not be modified
    after calling the function and before the callback function has been called
    or the SERCOM0_SPI_IsBusy() function returns false.

    txSize - Number of bytes to be transmitted. For 9 bit mode, 2 bytes make up
    a count of 1.

  Returns:
    true - If configured for Non-interrupt mode, the function has transmitted
    the requested number of bytes. If configured for Interrupt mode, the request
    was accepted successfully and will be processed in the interrupt.

    false - If pTransmitData is NULL. In Interrupt mode, the function will
    additionally return false if there is an on-going data transfer at the time
    of calling the function.

  Example:
    <code>
    uint8_t txBuffer[4];
    size_t txSize = 4;

    void APP_SPITransferHandler(uintptr_t context)
    {
        Transfer was completed without error, do something else now.
