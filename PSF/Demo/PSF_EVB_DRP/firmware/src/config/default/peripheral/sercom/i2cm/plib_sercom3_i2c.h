/* Function:
    void SERCOM3_I2C_Initialize(void)

  Summary:
    Initializes the instance of the SERCOM peripheral operating in I2C mode.

  Description:
    This function initializes the given instance of the SERCOM I2C peripheral as
    configured by the user from the MHC.

  Precondition:
    The Generic Clock Generator should have been assigned to the SERCOMx
    Peripheral Clock Channel.

  Parameters:
    None.

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
        SERCOM3_I2C_Initialize();
    </code>

  Remarks:
    Stops the SERCOM I2C if it was already running and reinitializes it.

/* Function:
    bool SERCOM3_I2C_Read(uint16_t address, uint8_t *pdata,

  Summary:
    Reads data from the slave.

  Description:
    This function reads the data from a slave on the bus. The function will
    attempt to read length number of bytes into pdata buffer from a slave whose
    address is specified as address. The I2C Master generate a Start condition,
    read the data and then generate a Stop Condition. If the Master lost
    arbitration, then the library will attempt to regain the control of the bus.
    If the slave NAKs the request or a bus error is encountered on the bus, the
    transfer is terminated. The application can call SERCOM3_I2C_ErrorGet()
    function to know that cause of the error.

    The function is non-blocking. It initiates bus activity and returns
    immediately. The transfer is completed in the peripheral interrupt. A
    transfer request cannot be placed when another transfer is in progress.
    Calling the read function when another function is already in progress will
    cause the function to return false.

    The library will call the registered callback function when the transfer has
    terminated if callback is registered.

  Precondition:
    SERCOM3_I2C_Initialize must have been called for the associated
    SERCOM I2C instance. At least one TRB should be available.

  Parameters:
    address - 7-bit / 10-bit slave address.

    data    - pointer to destination data buffer where the received data should
              be stored.

    length  - length of data buffer in number of bytes. Also the number of bytes
              to be read.

  Returns:
    true  - The request was placed successfully and the bus activity was
            initiated.

    false - The request fails,if there was already a transfer in progress when this
            function was called.

  Example:
    <code>
        uint8_t myData [NUM_BYTES];
        uint8_t myData [NUM_BYTES];
        void MyI2CCallback(uintptr_t context)
        {
            // This function will be called when the transfer completes. Note
            // that this functioin executes in the context of the I2C interrupt.
        }

  Summary:
    Writes data to the slave.

  Description:
    This function writes data to a slave on the bus. The function will attempt
    to write length number of bytes from pdata buffer to a slave whose address
    is specified by address. The I2C Master will generate a Start condition,
    write the data and then generate a Stop Condition. If the Master lost
    arbitration, then the library will attempt to regain the control of the bus.
    If the slave NAKs the request or a bus error was encountered on the bus, the
    transfer is terminated. The application can call the
    SERCOM3_I2C_ErrorGet()
    function to know that cause of the error.

    The function is non-blocking. It initiates bus activity and returns
    immediately. The transfer is then completed in the peripheral interrupt. A
    transfer request cannot be placed when another transfer is in progress.
    Calling the write function when another function is already in progress will
    cause the function to return false.

    The library will call the registered callback function when the transfer has
    terminated.

  Precondition:
    SERCOM3_I2C_Initialize must have been called for the associated
    SERCOM I2C instance.  At least one TRB should be available.

  Parameters:
    address - 7-bit / 10-bit slave address.

    data    - pointer to source data buffer that contains the data to be
              transmitted.

    length  - length of data buffer in number of bytes. Also the number of bytes
              to be written.

  Returns:
    true  - The request was placed successfully and the bus activity was
    initiated.

    false - The request fails,if there was already a transfer in progress when this function
            was called. .

  Summary:
    Write and Read data from Slave.

  Description:
    This function writes data from the wdata to the bus and then reads data from
    the slave and stores the received in the rdata. The function generates a
    Start condition on the bus and will then send wlength number of bytes
    contained in wdata. The function will then insert a Repeated start condition
    and proceeed to read rlength number of bytes from the slave. The received
    bytes are stored in rdata buffer. A Stop condition is generated after the
    last byte has been received.

    If the Master lost arbitration, then the library will attempt to regain the
    control of the bus.  If the slave NAKs the request or a bus error was
    encountered on the bus, the transfer is terminated. The application can call
    SERCOM3_I2C_ErrorGet()function to know that cause of the error.

    The function is non-blocking. It initiates bus activity and returns
    immediately. The transfer is then completed in the peripheral interrupt. A
    transfer request cannot be placed when another transfer is in progress.
    Calling this function when another function is already in progress will
    cause the function to return false.

    The library will call the registered callback function when the transfer has
    terminated.

  Precondition:
    SERCOM3_I2C_Initialize must have been called for the associated
    SERCOM I2C instance.  A minimum of two TRB's should be available.

  Parameters:
    address - 7-bit / 10-bit slave address.

    wdata   - pointer to write data buffer

    wlength - write data length in bytes.

    rdata   - pointer to read data buffer.

    rlength - read data length in bytes.

  Returns:
    true  - The request was placed successfully and the bus activity was
    initiated.

    false - The request fails, if there was already a transfer in progress when this
    function was called.

  Example:
    <code>
        uint8_t myTxData [NUM_BYTES] = {'1', '0', ' ', 'B', 'Y', 'T', 'E', 'S'};
        uint8_t myRxData [NUM_BYTES] = {0};

        void MyI2CCallback(uintptr_t context)
        {
            // This function will be called when the transfer completes. Note
            // that this functioin executes in the context of the I2C interrupt.

        {
            // error handling
        }


    </code>

  Remarks:
    Calling this function is not the same as calling the SERCOM3_I2C_Write()
    function and then calling the SERCOM3_I2C_Read() function.
    The SERCOM3_I2C_WriteRead function will insert a Repeated Start
    condition between the Write and the Read stages. The SERCOM3_I2C_Write()
    and the SERCOM3_I2C_Read() function insert a stop condtion after
    the write and the read has completed.

  Summary:
    Returns the Peripheral busy status.

  Description:
    This function ture if the SERCOM SERCOM3I2C module is busy with a
    transfer. The application can use the function to check if SERCOM
    SERCOM3I2C module is busy before calling any of the data transfer
    functions. The library does not allow a data transfer operation if another
    transfer operation is already in progress.

  Precondition:

   Summary:
    Sets the pointer to the function (and it's context) to be called when the
    given SERCOM I2C's transfer events occur.

  Description:
    This function sets the pointer to a client function to be called "back" when
    the given SERCOM I2C's transfer events occur. It also passes a context value
    (usually a pointer to a context structure) that is passed into the function
    when it is called. The specified callback function will be called from the
    peripheral interrupt context.

  Precondition:
    SERCOM3_I2C_Initialize must have been called for the associated
    SERCOM I2C instance.

  Parameters:
    callback      - A pointer to a function with a calling signature defined by
                    the SERCOM_I2C_CALLBACK data type. Setting this to NULl
                    disables the callback feature.

    contextHandle - A value (usually a pointer) passed (unused) into the
                    function identified by the callback parameter.

  Returns:
