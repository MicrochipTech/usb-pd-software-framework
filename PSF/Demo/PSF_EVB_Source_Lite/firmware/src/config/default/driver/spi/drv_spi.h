/* SPI Driver Transfer Handle

  Summary:
    Handle identifying the transfer request queued.

  Description:
    A transfer handle value is returned by a call to the DRV_SPI_ReadTransferAdd
    or DRV_SPI_WriteTransferAdd or DRV_SPI_WriteReadTransferAdd functions. This
    handle is associated with the transfer request passed into the function and it
    allows the application to track the completion of the transfer request.
    The transfer handle value returned from the "transfer add"
    function is returned back to the client by the "event handler callback"
    function registered with the driver.

    This handle can also be used to poll the transfer completion status using
    DRV_SPI_TransferStatusGet API.

    The transfer handle assigned to a client request expires when a new transfer
    request is made after the completion of the current request.

  Remarks:
    None

  Description:
    This is the definition of an invalid transfer handle. An invalid transfer
    handle is returned by DRV_SPI_WriteReadTransferAdd or DRV_SPI_WriteTransferAdd
    or DRV_SPI_ReadTransferAdd function if the buffer add request was not
    successful. It can happen due to invalid arguments or lack of space in the

/* SPI Driver Transfer Event Handler Function Pointer

   Summary
    Pointer to a SPI Driver Transfer Event handler function

   Description
    This data type defines the required function signature for the SPI driver
    transfer event handling callback function. A client must register a pointer
    using the transfer event handling function whose function signature (parameter
    and return value types) match the types specified by this function pointer
    in order to receive transfer related event calls back from the driver.

    The parameters and return values are described here and a partial example
    implementation is provided.

  Parameters:
    event -             Identifies the type of event

    transferHandle -    Handle identifying the transfer to which the event relates

    context -           Value identifying the context of the application that
                        registered the event handling function.

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    void APP_MyTransferEventHandler( DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_EVENT event,
                                   DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_HANDLE transferHandle,
                                   uintptr_t context )
    {
        MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT pAppData = (MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT) context;

        switch(event)
        {
            case DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_EVENT_COMPLETE:

                // Handle the completed transfer.
                break;

            case DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_EVENT_ERROR:

                // Handle error.
                break;
        }
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    - If the event is DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_EVENT_COMPLETE, it means that the data was
      transferred successfully.

    - If the event is DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_EVENT_ERROR, it means that the data was not
      transferred successfully.

    - The transferHandle parameter contains the transfer handle of the transfer
      request that is associated with the event.

    - The context parameter contains the a handle to the client context,
      provided at the time the event handling function was registered using the
      DRV_SPI_TransferEventHandlerSet function.  This context handle value is
      passed back to the client as the "context" parameter.  It can be any value
      necessary to identify the client context or instance (such as a pointer to
      the client's data) of the client that made the transfer add request.

    - The event handler function executes in interrupt context of the peripheral.
      Hence it is recommended of the application to not perform process
      intensive or blocking operations with in this function.

    - The DRV_SPI_ReadTransferAdd, DRV_SPI_WriteTransferAdd and
      DRV_SPI_WriteReadTransferAdd functions can be called in the event handler
      to add a transfer request to the driver queue. These functions can only
      be called to add transfers to the driver instance whose event handler is
      running. For example, SPI2 driver transfer requests cannot be added in SPI1
      driver event handler. Similarly, SPIx transfer requests should not be added
      in event handler of any other peripheral.

  Summary:
    Initializes the SPI instance for the specified driver index.

  Description:
    This routine initializes the SPI driver instance for the specified driver
    index, making it ready for clients to open and use it. The initialization
    data is specified by the init parameter. The initialization may fail if the
    number of driver objects allocated are insufficient or if the specified
    driver instance is already initialized. The driver instance index is
    independent of the SPI module ID. For example, driver instance 0 can be
    assigned to SPI2.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    index - Identifier for the instance to be initialized

    init  - Pointer to the init data structure containing any data necessary to
            initialize the driver.

  Returns:
    If successful, returns a valid handle to a driver instance object.

  Summary:
    Opens the specified SPI driver instance and returns a handle to it.

  Description:
    This routine opens the specified SPI driver instance and provides a
    handle that must be provided to all other client-level operations to
    identify the caller and the instance of the driver. The ioIntent
    parameter defines how the client interacts with this driver instance.

    Specifying a DRV_IO_INTENT_EXCLUSIVE will cause the driver to provide
    exclusive access to this client. The driver cannot be opened by any
    other client.

  Precondition:
    Function DRV_SPI_Initialize must have been called before calling this
    function.

  Parameters:
    index  -    Identifier for the object instance to be opened

    intent -    Zero or more of the values from the enumeration DRV_IO_INTENT
                "ORed" together to indicate the intended use of the driver.
                See function description for details.

  Returns:
    If successful, the routine returns a valid open-instance handle (a number
    identifying both the caller and the module instance).

    If an error occurs, the return value is DRV_HANDLE_INVALID. Error can occur
    - if the number of client objects allocated via DRV_SPI_CLIENTS_NUMBER is
      insufficient.
    - if the client is trying to open the driver but driver has been opened
      exclusively by another client.
    - if the driver peripheral instance being opened is not initialized or is
      invalid.
    - if the client is trying to open the driver exclusively, but has already
      been opened in a non exclusive mode by another client.
    - if the driver is not ready to be opened, typically when the initialize
      routine has not completed execution.

  Description:
    This function is used to update any of the DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_SETUP
    parameters for the selected client of the driver dynamically. For single
    client scenario, if GPIO has to be used for chip select, then calling this
    API with appropriate GPIO pin information becomes mandatory. For multi

    clock settings, chip select etc, then also calling this API is mandatory.

    Note that all the elements of setup structure must be filled appropriately
    before using this API.

  Preconditions:
    DRV_SPI_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

  Parameters:

  Summary:
    Queues a write-read transfer operation.

  Description:
    This function schedules a non-blocking write-read operation. The function
    returns with a valid transfer handle in the transferHandle argument if
    the request was scheduled successfully. The function adds the request to
    the instance specific software queue and returns immediately. While the
    request is in the queue, the application buffer is owned by the driver
    and should not be modified.
    This API will write txSize and at the same time counting of rxSize to be
    read will start. If user wants 'n' bytes to be read after txSize has been
    written, then he should keep rxSize value as 'txSize + n'.

    The function returns DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_HANDLE_INVALID in the
    transferHandle argument:
    - if neither of the transmit or receive arguments are valid.
    - if the transfer handle is NULL.
    - if the queue size is full or queue depth is insufficient.
    - if the driver handle is invalid.

    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver, the
    driver will issue a DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_EVENT_COMPLETE event if the transfer
    was processed successfully or DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_EVENT_ERROR event if the
    transfer was not processed successfully.

  Precondition:
    - DRV_SPI_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.
    - DRV_SPI_TransferSetup must have been called if GPIO pin has to be used for
    chip select or any of the setup parameters has to be changed dynamically.

  Parameters:
    handle -    Handle of the communication channel as returned by the
                DRV_SPI_Open function.

    *pTransmitData- Pointer to the data which has to be transmitted. If it is
                    NULL, that means only data receiving is expected.
    txSize-         Number of bytes to be transmitted. The size must be specified
                    in terms of the SPI data width. For example, if the data width
                    is 8-bits, and if 10 bytes are being transmitted, then the txSize
                    must be set to 10. If the data width is 16-bits then transmitting
                    10 bytes requires specifying the txSize as 10 (meaning 10 16-bit words).
    *pReceiveData-  Pointer to the location where received data has to be stored.
                    It is user's responsibility to ensure pointed location has
                    sufficient memory to store the read data.
                    if it is NULL, that means only data transmission is expected.

    rxSize-         Number of bytes to be received. The size must be specified
                    in terms of the SPI data width. For example, if the data width
                    is 8-bits, and if 10 bytes are being received, then the rxSize
                    must be set to 10. If the data width is 16-bits then receiving
                    10 bytes requires specifying the rxSize as 10 (meaning 10 16-bit words).
                    If "n" number of bytes has to be received AFTER transmitting
                    "m" number of bytes, then "txSize" should be set as "m" and
                    "rxSize" should be set as "m+n".

    transferHandle - Handle which is returned by transfer add function.

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>

    MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;
    uint8_t myTxBuffer[MY_TX_BUFFER_SIZE];
    uint8_t myRxBuffer[MY_RX_BUFFER_SIZE];
    DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_HANDLE transferHandle;

    // mySPIHandle is the handle returned by the DRV_SPI_Open function.

    DRV_SPI_WriteReadTransferAdd(mySPIhandle, myTxBuffer, MY_TX_BUFFER_SIZE,
                                    myRxBuffer, MY_RX_BUFFER_SIZE, &transferHandle);

    if(transferHandle == DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_HANDLE_INVALID)
    {
        // Error handling here
    }

    // Event is received when the transfer is processed.
    </code>

  Remarks:
    - This function can be called from within the SPI Driver Transfer Event
      Handler that is registered by the client.
    - It should not be called in the event handler associated with another SPI
      driver instance or event handler of any other peripheral.

  Summary:
    Queues a write operation.

  Description:
    This function schedules a non-blocking write operation. The function
    returns with a valid transfer handle in the transferHandle argument if
    the request was scheduled successfully. The function adds the request to
    the instance specific software queue and returns immediately. While the
    request is in the queue, the application buffer is owned by the driver
    and should not be modified.
    This API will write txSize bytes of data and the dummy data received will
    be ignored.

    The function returns DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_HANDLE_INVALID in the
    transferHandle argument:
    - if pTransmitData is NULL.
    - if txSize is zero.
    - if the transfer handle is NULL.
    - if the queue size is full or queue depth is insufficient.
    - if the driver handle is invalid.

    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver, the
    driver will issue a DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_EVENT_COMPLETE event if the transfer
    was processed successfully or DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_EVENT_ERROR event if the
    transfer was not processed successfully.

  Precondition:
    - DRV_SPI_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.
    - DRV_SPI_TransferSetup must have been called if GPIO pin has to be used for
      chip select or any of the setup parameters has to be changed dynamically.

  Parameters:
    handle -    Handle of the communication channel as returned by the
                DRV_SPI_Open function.

    *pTransmitData- Pointer to the data which has to be transmitted.

    txSize-         Number of bytes to be transmitted. The size must be specified
                    in terms of the SPI data width. For example, if the data width
                    is 8-bits, and if 10 bytes are being transmitted, then the txSize
                    must be set to 10. If the data width is 16-bits then transmitting
                    10 bytes requires specifying the txSize as 10 (meaning 10 16-bit words).
    transferHandle - Handle which is returned by transfer add function.

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>

    MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;
    uint8_t myTxBuffer[MY_TX_BUFFER_SIZE];
    DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_HANDLE transferHandle;

    // mySPIHandle is the handle returned by the DRV_SPI_Open function.

    DRV_SPI_WriteTransferAdd(mySPIhandle, myTxBuffer, MY_TX_BUFFER_SIZE, &transferHandle);

    if(transferHandle == DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_HANDLE_INVALID)
    {
        // Error handling here
    }

    // Event is received when the transfer is processed.
    </code>

  Remarks:
    - This function can be called from within the SPI Driver Transfer Event
      Handler that is registered by the client.
    - It should NOT be called in the event handler associated with another SPI
      driver instance or event handler of any other peripheral.
    - It should not be called directly in any ISR.

  Summary:
    Queues a read operation.

  Description:
    This function schedules a non-blocking read operation. The function
    returns with a valid transfer handle in the transferHandle argument if
    the request was scheduled successfully. The function adds the request to
    the instance specific software queue and returns immediately. While the

    and should not be modified.
    This API will write rxSize bytes of dummy data and  will read rxSize bytes
    of data in the memory location pointed by pReceiveData.

    The function returns DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_HANDLE_INVALID in the
    transferHandle argument:
    - if pReceiveData is NULL.
    - if rxSize is zero.
    - if the transfer handle is NULL.

    *pReceiveData-  Pointer to the location where received data has to be stored.
                    It is user's responsibility to ensure pointed location has
                    sufficient memory to store the read data.
    rxSize-         Number of bytes to be received. The size must be specified

    )

  Summary:
    Allows a client to set a transfer event handling function for the driver
    to call back when queued transfer has finished.

  Description:
    This function allows a client to register a transfer event handling function
    with the driver to call back when queued transfer has finished.
    When a client calls either the DRV_SPI_ReadTransferAdd or
    DRV_SPI_WriteTransferAdd or DRV_SPI_WriteReadTransferAdd function, it is
    provided with a handle identifying the transfer request that was added to the
    driver's queue.  The driver will pass this handle back to the
    client by calling "eventHandler" function when the transfer has
    completed.

    The event handler should be set before the client performs any "transfer add"
    operations that could generate events. The event handler once set, persists
    until the client closes the driver or sets another event handler (which
    could be a "NULL" pointer to indicate no callback).

  Precondition:
    DRV_SPI_Open must have been called to obtain a valid open instance handle.

  Parameters:
    handle -    A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open
                routine.

    eventHandler - Pointer to the event handler function.

    context -   The value of parameter will be passed back to the client
                unchanged, when the eventHandler function is called. It can be
                used to identify any client specific data object that
                identifies the instance of the client module (for example, it
                may be a pointer to the client module's state structure).

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    // myAppObj is an application specific state data object.
    MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;

  Summary:
    Use this API to lock the SPI driver for exclusive use by a client.

  Description:
    This function provides exclusive access to the calling SPI driver client. Once
    a client acquires exclusive access, SPI read/write requests from other clients
    are not accepted by the driver until the client gives up the exclusive use of the
    SPI driver.

  Precondition:
    - DRV_SPI_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle -    Handle of the communication channel as returned by the
                DRV_SPI_Open function.
    lock - true - lock the spi driver
         - false - unlock the spi driver

  Returns:
    - true - driver instance successfully acquired for exclusive access
    - false - failed to acquire driver instance in exclusive mode

  Example:
    <code>

    // mySPIHandle is the handle returned by the DRV_SPI_Open function.

    bool DRV_SPI_Lock( mySPIHandle, true );

    </code>

  Remarks:
    - When a client successfully acquires the lock for the first time,
      the lock count is set to one. Every time a client relocks this driver instance,
      the lock count is incremented by one. Each time the client unlocks the driver instance,
      the lock count is decremented by one. When the lock count reaches zero, the driver
      instance becomes available for other clients.
      If a client attempts to unlock the driver instance that it has not locked then the lock
      count is not decremented.
    - This API must not be called from an interrupt handler as it may block on a RTOS mutex
