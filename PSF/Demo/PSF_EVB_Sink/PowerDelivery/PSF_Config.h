    Power Fault Condition. Setting the INCLUDE_UPD_PIO_OVERRIDE_SUPPORT as 1 enables this feature.
    User can set this define to 0 to reduce code size of PSF if PIO override based 
    power faulting is not required.
Remarks:
    To use this feature, EN_VBUS and FAULT_IN Pin of the system should be UPD350 PIOs.
    It is also confined to INCLUDE_POWER_FAULT_HANDLING define, thus INCLUDE_POWER_FAULT_HANDLING
    should be declared as 1 for INCLUDE_UPD_PIO_OVERRIDE_SUPPORT define to be effective. 
    Recommended default value is 1 if UPD350 PIOs are used for EN_VBUS and FAULT_IN.

Summary:

Description:
    CONFIG_DEFINE_UPD350_HW_INTF_SEL defines the Hardware interface for communication between
    the SOC and UPD350. It can take either CONFIG_UPD350_SPI or CONFIG_UPD350_I2C as input value.
	
	<b>CONFIG_UPD350_SPI</b> - SPI is the communication interface between SOC and UPD350.
									SPI interface is supported by UPD350 B and D parts alone.
	
	<b>CONFIG_UPD350_I2C</b> - I2C is the communication interface between SOC and UPD350.
									I2C interface is supported by UPD350 A and C parts alone.
Remarks:
    CONFIG_DEFINE_UPD350_HW_INTF_SEL should be defined based on UPD350 silicon part used for the
    application. All the ports in a system should use either I2C supported or SPI supported 
    UPD350 part. Using mixed interfaces for individual ports is not supported (i.e.: SPI for 
	Port 1 and I2C for Port 2).

Example:
    <code>
	#define CONFIG_DEFINE_UPD350_HW_INTF_SEL    CONFIG_UPD350_SPI
	#define CONFIG_DEFINE_UPD350_HW_INTF_SEL    CONFIG_UPD350_I2C
    </code>

Note:
	If the target for PSF is a UPD301C device, SPI must always be selected. I2C is not an option 
	for UPD301C due to the physical bonding of the UPD301C.
